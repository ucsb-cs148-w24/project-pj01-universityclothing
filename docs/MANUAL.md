# User Manual
## Product Purpose

This application is designed specifically for UCSB students to buy and sell second-hand items and clothing within the campus community. Our aim is to provide a convenient, safe, and localized platform for students to engage in sustainable shopping practices, reduce waste, and find affordable options that are logistically feasible. By limiting the user base to the UCSB community, we aim to minimize shipping issues and online scams, creating a trusted environment for transactions.

- **Exchange/Transfer Students:** Those in need of temporary furnishings or clothing, seeking budget-friendly and accessible options.
- **Sustainable Shoppers:** Students who are conscious about reducing waste and prefer buying second-hand items.
- **Students Without Vehicles:** Those who need items that are easy to transport or close to campus due to lack of personal transport.
