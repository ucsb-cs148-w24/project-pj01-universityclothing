## Feedback Grouped and Sorted
- I recommend toning down the accent colors a bit, maybe use grey for the tabbar icons except the active one (blue)
- For some feedback, what niche does this app provide that's different from other marketplace apps? Also, what's next for the complexity of the app?
- I'm a bit confused by how a user would attach an image to their item listing, since the example item does not include an image, but the placeholder items have images attached
## Response Actions
- We believe the blue and yellow theme is suitable for our school theme.
- The app differs from other marketplace applications, such as Facebook Marketplace, by limiting its usage exclusively to UCSB users, where each school email is restricted to registering only one account. With this approach, we aim to minimize the risk of scams, ensuring that both sellers and buyers are genuine individuals; and that when there is a issue, there is someone we can reach out.
- The post image botton for the MVP is a placeholder as we did not connect it to firebase yet; for the MVP we can only update the image by pasting the image url. 
## Next Steps
- Update the post page so that the theme aligns with the homepage, and users can post images properly.
