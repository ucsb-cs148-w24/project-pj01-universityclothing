## Feedback Grouped and Sorted
- I recommend toning down the accent colors a bit, maybe use grey for the tabbar icons except the active one (blue)
- For some feedback, what niche does this app provide that's different from other marketplace apps? Also, what's next for the complexity of the app?
- I'm a bit confused by how a user would attach an image to their item listing, since the example item does not include an image, but the placeholder items have images attached
