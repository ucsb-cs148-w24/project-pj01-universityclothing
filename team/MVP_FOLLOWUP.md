## Feedback Grouped and Sorted
### Evaluation about our UI design: the color, the button,..
- The team has good foundational features such as filtering which make the product immediately useful and effective
I recommend toning down the accent colors a bit, maybe use grey for the tabbar icons except the active one (blue)
- I think that the interface should be more colorful.
- looks great, design is pretty intuitive, but I would potentially think about how to condense the pages since I don't think you need that many tabs for an app that is niche
- UI is good for a MVP
- I think the product is good and well built. The vision is great and the posting seems simple and easy.
- I think the UI looks neat and straightforward. Probably include more functionalities in the future.
- A bit of formatting might be more attractive for users. Overall nice job.
- The app looks good so far! I think the UI should be touched on but that's a minor thing that comes later down the road. Good work!
- User interface is very clean and it may be nice to have an inventory screen to see how much of an item is left
- make the interface prettier
- Great work for an MVP. For the next iteration, maybe consider ways to condition tab pages on the bottom.
- I think this is really cool and a great resource but I dont know if I really enjoyed the UI, I think it could maybe have a more captivating color scheme?
- It is looking very nice, but the home page looks off, rest of app looks good.
- I like the progress that the team has made so far. The UI looks easy to use and friendly for first-time shoppers, and overall their project idea looks interesting and very achievable within the quarter.

### comments about the presentation
- the project seems really cool! I think it might be nicer if the presentation details more use cases of the app and the need for it

### structure
- Think the design was good, but you can probably go crazy with the CSS even more in the design.

### the difference from the Facebook or other similar App
- For some feedback, what niche does this app provide that's different from other marketplace apps? Also, what's next for the complexity of the app?
- It needs to add more unique features to differentiate itself from UCSB Facebook Marketplace bc otherwise I just use Facebook
- They could have gone more into depth about the product and explored more use cases.
- I think that the UI looks nice and the app's functionalities seem to work well. I think that it could be more clearly stated how your app differs from other resale apps like facebook marketplace and where it's niche lies.
  
### Issues we have right now
- I'm a bit confused by how a user would attach an image to their item listing, since the example item does not include an image, but the placeholder items have images attached
- I think the dropdown glitched a little bit as everyone noticed, but it seems like a cool idea.
  
### Feature we could consider in the future
- As a future feature, an offer button or way to message and negotiate a different price would be useful for any marketplace app. 
- Great job! I'm excited to see how you guys implement the search function and what other ideas are there to come with this.
- filter improvement: This app looks pretty cool. I'm excited to see what they can do with it in the future. I think a location aspect could be interesting and helpful for item searching.
- I like the idea! There are a lot of scams out there, so this adds a level of security for both buyers and sellers. I think the idea of adding more tags after a custom tag is added often is good, as not all items will easily fit into those four categories. Overall, good work! Maybe adding a way to communicate between the buyer/seller, or giving their phone numbers would be good. Also, having shipping options would be cool, but not required (as the app is designed for local anyways).
- I think it would be great to have a feature where you can rate sellers on the account (this way, people have an idea if a seller is a common / trustworthy seller), and also a way to see other items listed by the same seller.

## Response Actions
- We believe the blue and yellow theme is suitable for our school theme.
- The app differs from other marketplace applications, such as Facebook Marketplace, by limiting its usage exclusively to UCSB users, where each school email is restricted to registering only one account. With this approach, we aim to minimize the risk of scams, ensuring that both sellers and buyers are genuine individuals; and that when there is a issue, there is someone we can reach out.
- The post image botton for the MVP is a placeholder as we did not connect it to firebase yet; for the MVP we can only update the image by pasting the image url.
- Our team is considering implimenting several features that have mentioned in the feed back, including adding mroe tags and a rating sysytem. 
## Next Steps
- Update the post page so that the theme aligns with the homepage, and users can post images properly.
- Impliment a chat system where users are able to communicate with one another for purchases.
- Edit the rest of the pages so it has the same aesthetic.
