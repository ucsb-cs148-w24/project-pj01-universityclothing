## Action item

* a goal: start coding and let each other know what specific feature you are working on. 
* a change/experiment: stop only talking to each other in class and arrange meetings outside of the class.
* a continue: share resources on Discord. 
* a measurement: record the number of times we meet outside of class and see if that helped to progress our project. 

## Additional Retros
  
### Ridhit
* Start coding so that we can learn the tech stack. 
* Stop not documenting meetings. 
* Continue communicating what we are doing and what needs to be done. 

### Justin
* We need to start working on issues to start making progress towards deadlines.
* We need to stop relying on only class times to meet to avoid procrastinating.
* We need to continue being communicative over Discord so that we are always in the loop.

### Zhen  
* We should start helping each other if someone needs it.
* We need to stop giving up doing our part without any explanation. Continue:
* We should continue to communicate with each other about what we will do next.

### Jonathan
* Start having more communication with the team on the issues we want to work on.
* Stop pushing to main/merging PR without testing.
* Continue reminding team members of the assignments' deadlines and requirements, and keep being helpful.

### Anika
* Start having each person say something they've done each meeting per person, even if it's small.
* Stop having scrums where not everyone talks. 
* Continue sharing in Discord helpful resources.

### Xinyao 
* Start to be more proactive on tasks and put down unassigned issues on the Kanban board when something is in mind so there will be  always something to do in the future.
* Continue to report to the team what you did on Discord and carry out active discussions.

### Kevin 
* Start talking to TAs more for advice.
* Stop pushing to main immediately without doing branches
* Continue knowing what to do next, prioritizing tasks, and figuring out which should be done first and who should do it so we can continue being on track

## Retro Assessment

* We used the start/stop/continue method in this retro.
* I would say our first retro went pretty well despite still figuring how things work. We were able to exchanges ideas and agreeged on a common goal and experiment to do.
* Maybe have a agenda before starting so we know what steps we are on.
