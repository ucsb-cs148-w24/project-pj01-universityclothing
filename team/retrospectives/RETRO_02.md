## Retro Assessment
* We think about the question about "Goal and Change", and send the answer in the discord chat
* The leader leads us to share our specific opinions one by one.
* Then, we summary everyone's opinions and try to be in agreement.
* Kevin is this week's leader, and he just asked the progress whhen we meet in the classroom. He gave a guidance for each of issues we are working on.
* Suggestion: Let everyone give more details about their opinions.
  
## Outcome of our RETRO 2
* All of us finish at least one issue in the week, so it shows that our experiment works so far.
* We will continue this change and assign a new leader in the next week.
