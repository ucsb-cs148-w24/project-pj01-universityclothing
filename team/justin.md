My name is Justin Chung, and I'm a third year CS student. I like buying second hand clothes often through applications such as FaceBook Messenger and Depop, but there are many issues that come with either. These include things like:
- Having to scroll past too many non-clothing items
- Finding clothes that are too far to pickup
- Many items being more low quality than advertised
- Other reasons for untrustworthy sellers and business

Thus, I want to make this project solely for university students and alumni to purchase and sell their clothing. To expand our vision with remaining time, we can include any non-clothing items as well.
