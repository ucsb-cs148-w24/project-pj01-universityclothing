My name is Xinyao, a junior Computer Science major with a strong interest in front-end design and a variety of video games. Living in Isla Vista, I've noticed that when the semester ends, there are often second-hand products such as clothing, furniture, and electronics simply left on the streets, which is quite disheartening. My vision for this project is to create an application exclusively for verified students to sell their second-hand items. This application will distinguish itself from existing similar platforms by ensuring that users are within the university's community, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to outside scams and minimizing shipping difficulties.
