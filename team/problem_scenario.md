## Problem:
* In the university, everyone may faces a situation that they want to have something anymore. Then, students want to have a platform to let them safely sell those used goods. At this same time, there are so many things that people only need them when they are students. They are more willing to buy used products as a cheaper price.
  
  
## What we want to do:
* Our App will provide an exchange platform, but uses need to be certificated as students.

## Problem Senario:
* Sasaki Tsuruka is a 19-year-old Japanese transfer student planning to study for two years at UCSB. Since most apartments here do not contain any furniture, she needs a dependable platform to purchase second-hand furniture and household items. As her stay is temporary, it is not smart to invest in new furnishings, which makes our application ideal for her needs. Seeking affordable options and constrained by the lack of a vehicle, she turned to our app for second-hand furniture that she could afford and transport on her small bicycle. After signing up, Sasaki browsed the furniture category and discovered a comfortable work chair. Since the seller was another UCSB student living nearby, they arranged a pickup location close to the campus that was convenient for both of them. Following several similar purchases, Sasaki has successfully equipped her apartment and fulfilled her desires within budget and logistical constraints.
