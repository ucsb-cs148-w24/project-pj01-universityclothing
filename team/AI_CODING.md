Anika: Bing DALL-E Image Generator to create UI of the login page. This tool was very useful as it was able to create an eyecatching and engaging design that I couldn't have thought of myself. I think it will be useful going forward for any pages whose UI aren't yet designed to use Bing DALL-E to create images. In order to ensure that the AI was correct,I had to be very descriptive in my image creation.


Zhen Bi: 
- I used ChatGPT 3.5 to convert the formatting of the my code. Specifically, for the SearchScreen file, it is written in jsx, but I found a useful example in Youtube to help me to implement the search functions. However, the example is written by tsx,so I need to convert the format, and in this step I use AI.
- It is really useful since jsx and tsx has the similar functions, but I do not have to be fimiliar with both languages.
- I will read some examples that are written in tsx to be fimiliar with the format of tsx.


Kevin Chen:
- I used ChatGPT 3.5 to help format the homescreen page items to look like facebook marketplace. I then asked it to tweak certain features based on how I wanted the end product to look, and as a result it changed the styling to match my needs.
- I also tried github copilot to help with coding and it helped me code more efficiently since I didn't have to write a lot of code that had minimal changes, it automatically put the code for me.


Justin Chung:
- I used GitHub Copilot to learn how to successfully implement Firebase database features. This helped me accurately create tests for the Firestore functions, and now we can integrate it into the features.
- I also used ChatGPT to research different ways to implement our features (like the chat feature that we are currently implementing).
