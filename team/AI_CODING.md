Anika: Bing DALL-E Image Generator to create UI of the login page. This tool was very useful as it was able to create an eyecatching and engaging design that I couldn't have thought of myself. I think it will be useful going forward for any pages whose UI aren't yet designed to use Bing DALL-E to create images. In order to ensure that the AI was correct,I had to be very descriptive in my image creation.


Zhen Bi: 
- I used ChatGPT 3.5 to convert the formatting of the my code. Specifically, for the SearchScreen file, it is written in jsx, but I found a useful example in Youtube to help me to implement the search functions. However, the example is written by tsx,so I need to convert the format, and in this step I use AI.
- It is really useful since jsx and tsx has the similar functions, but I do not have to be fimiliar with both languages.
- I will read some examples that are written in tsx to be fimiliar with the format of tsx.
