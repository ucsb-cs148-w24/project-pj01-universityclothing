Hello! I am Ridhit, a third-year computer science major at UCSB. There are always students looking to buy and sell stuff but there aren't many great platforms for this. Most people use Facebook marketplace or Facebook groups, which can be unsafe since scammers can access these platforms. An app where students can be verified when selling would help a lot to improve the safety of this.
