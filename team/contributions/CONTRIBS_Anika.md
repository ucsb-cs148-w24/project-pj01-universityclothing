In the project, I worked on the following things:
- Creating the entire UI/UX Design for the login page
- Configuring Google Authorization and implementing it into our project in Firebase
- Verification of user's student status to ensure those who aren't students can't join or view
- Creating a backend HTML to handle redirect to app's Homepage
- Integrating Google Authorization with Jonathan's code to log new users into Firebase Database for proper posting
