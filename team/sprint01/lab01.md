## Add ourselves in the organization
## MVP
- We decided to do our project as a mobile app.
- Based on that, TA gave us some suggestions about the choice of Development Stack.
- Also, we decided that this app will have features: 
    - post images and information about used products
    - check what others are selling; add a wishlist
    - login with your edu email
    - a chat page.
- Planning to use react native since it allows us to create a mobile app easily and is very expandable.
