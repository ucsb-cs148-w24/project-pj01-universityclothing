My name is Zhen Bi, and I am an international student at UCSB.I know that it is not easy to pronounce my name, so you can also call me June. I transfered my major from Econ to Computer Science, so I did not have many experiences about writing a project. However,I do believe that I am better at back-end staffs. For our project, there is a mature example in China, which is a mobile app for all people in China to exchange their used goods. I believe that we could learn the user stories from that app, but our app could be targeted only people on the compus. That means we have specific ranges of what used products will be exchanged frequently, which could influence the design of our product.
