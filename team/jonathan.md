I'm Jonathan, a 4th year CS student at UCSB.

I've always loved the idea of making side hustles, and reselling is one of the many ideas I tried.

But the problem is that a lot of facebook marketplace and websites are full are scams, so that is why I want to create a app for university student to trade with people near them, people they can trust.

The app is not limited to selling used clothes and school related items. Anything can be sold here.
